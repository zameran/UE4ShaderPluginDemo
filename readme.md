**Basics**

Updated version of Temaran's Compute Shader Plugin to Unreal **4.17 - 4.18**. 
For more details see Temaran's original project: https://github.com/Temaran/UE4ShaderPluginDemo

**Details**
* In UE 4.17, Epic changed the way the rendering pipeline is accessed and added global shaders for plugin (for details see the release notes). This has made the "ShaderCopyPlugin" superfluous.
* On the first start, the shaders will get compiled by Unreal. This might take some time, so be patient. ;)
* This is a project plugin at the moment, as designed by Temaran. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to convert this into a engine plugin so far. When I manage to do this, I will insert it here in a new branch. If someone can or wants to help however, this would be cool as well!
* Raw ported to UE 4.18...
* For problems and other feedback contact me!
